## How does it work?

ü§ñ Uses Playwright to play the game and move around.  
üéØ Automatically spots and zooms in on interesting stuff (signs, landmarks, etc.) to get a better view.  
üîç Location detection using GPT-4o and O1 vision models  

## The Results üìä

Played 5 games (25 rounds) of the Classic Map with no-move (but allow pan and zoom).

`o1` performs insanely well with 91%+ accuracy! `4o` is significantly cheaper, faster, and performs almost as well.

## Implementation Notes
- `gpt-4o` required  prompt tweaking to work well. `o1` was smart enough to work with a very basic prompt.
- Performance drops on the `A Community World (ACW)` map to ~80% for `o1`. Why?
- How much does the zoom-in feature improve results?
