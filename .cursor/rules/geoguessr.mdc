- When writing a complex feature or changes, first write down the summary of the plan step by step in natural language. Have me approve it before writing any code.
When giving an answer, first think it through in <thinking> tags.
1. Identify core requirements
2. Consider 2-3 implementation approaches.
3. Choose simplest that meets needs.
4. If there is no obvious and clear best approach, write down a short summary and pros/cons of each approach. Ask me to pick one before writing any code.
4. Verify the solution with these questions:
  - Will this be clear to a junior dev?
  - Is the data flow and logic simple?

Python:
- Follow `pep8` guidelines.
- Add exact typing everywhere. Create custom types or dataclasses as needed.
- Always use `logger.exception` to properly log exception traces.
